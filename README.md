# AI Phraseify 
I developed a paraphrasing tool using ReactJS, HTML, CSS, Node.js, and the AI21 Labs API. This web application allows users to input text and receive a paraphrased version that also corrects any typos. Leveraging the generative AI capabilities of AI21 Labs, the tool ensures that the rephrased text retains the original meaning while enhancing clarity and correctness.

## Features
- Text Paraphrasing: Users can input text, and the tool generates a paraphrased version while maintaining the original meaning.
- Typo Correction: Automatically detects and corrects spelling and grammatical errors in the input text.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design for easy use.
- Real-Time Processing: Quick and efficient text processing for immediate results.

## Technologies Used
- React JS: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Vite: A fast development build tool that significantly improves the speed of development by leveraging native ES modules and modern browser features.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, used to make HTTP requests to the GitHub API.
- AI21 Labs API: For generating paraphrased text using generative AI technology.
